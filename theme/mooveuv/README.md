# Moodle plugin: theme_mooveuv #

## Motivation for this plugin
Moove UV is a customized Moodle theme (plugin) that changes the Moodle UI to match the design and brand of the Universidad del Valle. It is a child theme based on the <i>moove</i> theme which is also a child theme based on <i>boost</i>, the preinstalled theme that comes with Moodle. This means Moove UV inherits properties from <i>moove</i> and <i>boost</i> themes.

## Installation
Important: before proceeding make sure that you have all the dependencies installed first. You can take a look at them on the version.php file.
Once installed, run the following commands under Moodle root directory:
